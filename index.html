			<h2>Why learn about refugees?</h2>
			<p>The issue of refugees has been a hot topic for many years now. In the past decade, there have been massive changes in our society as we try to deal with this issue and make it work for everyone. The first thing that needs to be addressed is that most people do not understand what a refugee is. Refugees have fled their homes due to circumstances beyond their control, like war or natural disasters. They may also be forced from their homes due to persecution or violence. To qualify for asylum, refugees must meet certain criteria, like having a well-founded fear of persecution and being unable to return home because of the risk of harm or death upon return. The second thing that needs to be addressed is the fact that many different types of refugees are left all over the world: political refugees, economic refugees, asylees, and others. Each type has its own set of issues and rights, so it is vital to learn and understand them before presuming any stereotypes or prejudice portrayed by the media. </p>
			<h2>Why care for refugees?</h2>
				<p>The refugee crisis is a global issue that has been on the rise for years. It is a problem that requires immediate action, and that cannot be solved by any one country alone. The international community, especially the UN, must work together to find a solution to this problem.</p>
			<p>The primary step is to look at what causes refugees to come to our countries in the first place. There are many reasons why people choose to flee their homes, including war and persecution. However, most importantly, human rights abuses are happening in most countries which can lead to refugees fleeing those countries as well. For example, suppose an authoritarian government like China oppresses its citizens. In that case, they may have no choice but to leave as they suffer oppression while living under conditions they would otherwise not want.</p>
			<p>The people who flee their home country are often forced into dangerous situations that make it impossible for them to return home. Sometimes these conditions include not having enough food or water or being separated from family members who have been taken away by the government. Such situations can be very stressful for anyone, especially for those who cannot speak English or understand what is happening due to language barrier or cultural differences.
			</p>
			<p>Most refugees often end up in developing countries like Turkey, Colombia, Germany, and Uganda. They are expected to survive on little money and food without education or work experience. Furthermore, many refugees end up working low-paying jobs to pay for necessities. Being forced to work in low-paying jobs just so that they can survive decreases the chance of them affording housing and food independently. It also explains the need of most refugees, who must rely on help from charities or other organizations for their basic needs, such as housing and food assistance programs. Disregarding the prejudice and prevalent stereotypes portrayed by media on refugees, people should care for refugees to support the humanitarian cause, reinforcing the most precious right of all: the right to live.</p>
			<h2>How do scenarios affect one to become a refugee?</h2>
			<p>Several factors, including war, famine, and drought, have caused the refugee crisis. War is one of the most significant contributors to today's overwhelming number of refugees. Millions of people have been displaced due to conflicts in many countries throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe, resulting in massive migration flows towards Europe and other parts of the world where more resources are available (UNHCR). This has especially impacted women forced to travel alone or with their children due to gender-based violence against women and sexual violence experienced during conflict periods (UNICEF). These women often face further hardship when they arrive at their destination countries, where they often struggle financially due to limited access to employment opportunities which can lead them into poverty traps resulting in even more stress (UNICEF).</p>
			<p>Furthermore, a large number of refugees from Ukraine have fled conflicts in Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Donetsk and Kharkiv; however, many others have had their lives disrupted by manmade crises such as destruction of building and farm lands, which has made it difficult for them to meet basic needs like food, water, and shelter. The worst affected areas include regions of Eastern Ukraine, where over 2 million people were displaced from their homes due to Russian Invasion. This conflict has left several cities without access to water, electricity, and mobile phone networks (Kristy).</p>
			<p>Such situations have led people to make desperate choices to survive, with some resorting to drinking dirty water from rivers or wells and others selling their possessions to raise money for food. The UN estimates that more than 100 million refugees are now living worldwide.</p>
