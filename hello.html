                The United States has been in a debate over how to treat refugees. Some believe that we should not accept refugees, while others think that we should accept more of them. While there are many different opinions, here are some of the sociopolitical issues that surround this topic:
            </p>
            <p>The first issue is whether or not it is right for us to decide who can enter our country based on their religion or nationality. This is especially true in light of the civil war going on in Syria. We cannot turn away people who are escaping violence, even if we do not like their religion or race.</p>
            <p>The following issue is how much money we should spend on refugees. Many people do not want these refugees to come here because they think they will get better jobs than they would have in their home country. However, this is only sometimes true! Many refugees are forced to work in low-paying jobs since they do not yet have any experience in America's economy. Furthermore, even though some claim that America is spending too much on helping refugees, in reality, America spends 0.003% of its total budget to support refugees and their families (Phillips).</p>
            <p>Another such issue is whether or not it is okay for us to take any refugees at all. Some people think that it is not okay because they think that these people don't deserve to be here and that they're just taking advantage of the U.S.'s generosity by coming here without working hard enough or having any skills or education necessary for them to succeed here.However, it is not true at all. Data shows that from 2005 – 2014, the federal government spent approximately $206 billion on refugees – and yet, over the same period, refugees contributed more than $269 billion in tax revenue to federal, state, and local entities. That represents a net positive economic tax contribution of $63 billion (LIRS). Not only that, but research also shows that refugees boast high rates of entrepreneurship, outshining even that of other immigrants and U.S.-born citizens (NAE 4). This overall concludes that it is better to help and take in refugees that are not only morally right but also economically advantageous to the country.</p>
            <p>The final issue is whether or not we should try to protect ourselves from terrorism by keeping a particular community out altogether; however, this can lead to discrimination against other groups of people who may also be affected by terrorism which could cause even more problems down the road if we continue doing this. In the story "Montreal 1962" by Shauna Singh Baldwin, for the narrator's husband to wear a turban, he must put up with ignorance and discrimination. Furthermore, Geetanjali Singh, in her Scholarly Journal "Sikh Masculinity, Religion, and Diaspora in Shauna Singh Baldwin's English Lessons and Other Stories." mentions Singh Baldwin pointedly picking up on every day, apparently innocuous humiliations. However, these acts become more prominent acts of brutality that can be traced to actual events. A particular form of humiliation is well documented during the riots of 1947 and 1984, in which Sikh men were forced to remove their turbans, and their hair was cut before they were often burned alive by marauding mobs (Chanda and Ford 474). People unaware of the religion often relate it to the ISIS attack and mistake the Sikh turban for the Muslim Taqiyah cap. Even though Muslims and Sikhs are two different religions, unawareness among people results in much suffering for both groups of people (people who are not Muslim or Sikh and those who are Muslim and Sikh) who live together peacefully every day but need each other's help during times of crisis.</p>
