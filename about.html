			<p>The refugee resettlement process is a complex one, and it can be difficult to understand how it works. In order to do that, one needs to start with the basic facts:</p>
            <p>Refugee resettlement consists of three steps: screening and selection, orientation, and placement. The first step is screening and selection. This is done by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM). The bureau conducts interviews with refugees seeking to resettle in the United States and other relevant interviews that allow them to choose which refugees they want to admit into the country or which refugees they will refer for resettlement in other countries.</p>
            <p>The following step is orientation. This entails settling refugees in their new home country for six weeks to learn about their new life as Americans and become acclimated before relocating permanently. During this time, they receive free education from community colleges or local universities, as well as food assistance, clothing, medical care, support services such as employment counseling or mental health counseling as needed, and assistance in finding housing.</p>
            <p>The third step is placementâ€”this is where things get tricky! Placement refers to finding homes for refugees. This involves matching refugees with a host organization that can help them find housing and other necessary services. The process takes about six weeks. During this time, refugees receive free education through community colleges or local universities; food assistance; clothing; medical care; support services such as employment counseling or mental health counseling if needed; and help finding housing if necessary.</p>
            <img class="profile-img-left" src="Refugee Shelter.jpg" alt="Refugee Shelter">
            <p>There are two ways of doing this: through volunteer organizations or through government agencies. While volunteer organizations provide temporary safe housing and help refugees transition into life in the United States, government agencies provide permanent housing, but they generally do not have the capacity to help a refugee find a job or start a business.</p>
            <p>Both volunteer organizations and government agencies have their benefits, but both have drawbacks as well. The biggest drawback of using volunteer organizations is that they need more resources to help refugees find jobs or businesses; however, they can provide them with temporary shelter until they can move out independently. On the other hand, the biggest drawback of using government agencies is that most only offer temporary housing; however, some work with private companies that will rent apartments or houses for refugees who cannot find housing through other means (e.g., churches).</p>
            <p>Hence, the ideal way to place refugees is using both volunteer organizations and government agencies. This way, refugees can be placed in their new homes quickly while also being helped by volunteers who will help them acclimate to their new lives and surroundings.</p>
