			<p>Tying back all knots together in Conclusion, there are many stereotypes and misinformation about refugees and how they affect a country. In the Resettlement tab, we learn how refugees are screened, selected, and send for resettlement in the final stages. It exposes why the government needs to spend on refugees, as they cannot provide for themselves since they have no work to earn money or a place to stay. The Debates tab debunks the growing and popular myths regarding refugees. Refugees help boost the economy, supply a growing workforce and enrich cultures. Furthermore, In the Factor tab, we learn the further implications of this blog website and how it may help one develop his/her understanding of refugees and their problems. Hence, instead of judging refugees through their community or media portrayal, one needs to consider all aspects and factors of refugees to develop one's understanding of this topic.</p>
