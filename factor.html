          <p>
            Refugees are often seen as a threat to American culture and identity. 
            However, they are also the key to restoring this country's social fabric. 
            The current global refugee crisis has resulted in unprecedented levels of human suffering. 
            More than 65 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict or persecution, and over 22 million are refugees. 
            Most refugees come from just a few countries: Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar, and Somalia. 
            This complex issue has no easy solution, and various stakeholders have different interests and points of view (Esses et. al 80). 
            In order to fully understand the issue, it is necessary to consider all of the different factors involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first factor is how long the crisis will last. If it lasts less than a year or two, it will be hard for people to find jobs once they get back home. If it lasts longer than that, then there may be a permanent loss of income for the refugees and their communities until they can return home again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second factor is what happens with any money raised through donations or other private sources (such as bonds or loans). Some organizations have already collected enough money to begin building new homes for refugees in Jordan and Lebanon, but not enough to provide them with food or other essentials as well as medical care until they can work again; however, others have raised far more money than they need at this time so they will be able to provide both food and medical care.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third factor is how much aid is given by other countries and organizations. The United States has pledged $1 billion in aid to support UN Refugee Agencyâ€™s work for 2022, and several other countries have also pledged millions of dollars. However, it is unclear how the agencies plan to utilize the given aid as the expenditures are not published publicly. Furthermore, it is a matter of debate whether the aid will reach those who need it most.
